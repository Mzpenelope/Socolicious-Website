Clone the Repository:

As mentioned before, your partner should clone the GitHub repository to her local machine using the git clone command.
Locate the HTML File:

Navigate to the cloned repository directory on her local machine using the terminal or file explorer.
Open with a Web Browser:

Find the HTML file (in your case, "final.html") within the repository directory.
Right-click on the HTML file and choose "Open with" or simply double-click on it.
Select a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) from the options.
This will open the HTML file in her default web browser, and she can view the visuals of the website locally on her machine without the need for a server.
